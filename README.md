## Developing locally

Use pow to host the app at `http://dbc-calendar-event-importer.dev/`


## Stories

As a user I can give the app access to the google calendar for my location. Then I canâ€¦
- import an event from a meetup event url
- import an event from an eventbright event url
- setup auto event importing for a meetup group
the first two are manual
we can add more scrapers as wego
we can also add more automated importers
